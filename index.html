        <h2>üßë‚Äçüíº Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout my time in the Computer Science program at Southern New
          Hampshire University, I've grown from someone who was just curious
          about how things worked behind the screen to someone who now builds
          full applications from the ground up. When I started this program, I
          had some interest in web development but didn't really know what that
          path looked like. Over time, as I worked through different projects
          and courses, I started leaning more into backend development,
          databases, and understanding how everything ties together. Now, I know
          for sure that I want to pursue full stack development professionally.
          I enjoy being able to create something people interact with while also
          managing what's happening under the hood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creating this ePortfolio helped me pull everything I've learned
          together in one place and actually see how all the pieces connect. I
          built my Swiftside Rentals project from scratch starting with just a
          Vite + React frontend, and turned it into a full-stack app with user
          authentication, PostgreSQL integration, and admin tools. It's the kind
          of project I always wanted to make, and it shows off everything I've
          learned: managing routes, securing endpoints with JWT, building a
          database schema, and deploying the whole thing using Vercel. I didn't
          just learn the theory, I actually got to apply it in a way that feels
          real and complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working on this also made me realize the importance of clean
          communication, especially when writing code others might read later or
          when explaining decisions in writing. That's something I've gotten
          better at as I worked through the narratives for each enhancement.
          I've also practiced thinking more like a developer on a team, making
          sure my code is modular, documented, and scalable instead of just
          something that works one time.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of outcomes, I've covered all the major areas. I've worked
          with data structures and algorithms while optimizing vehicle
          availability checks. I've designed software using Express and React,
          and I've integrated databases through PostgreSQL with well structured
          schemas and foreign keys. I've also taken security seriously with
          password hashing, JWTs, and role based access. If there's one area I
          still want to improve, it's building bigger systems that involve
          collaboration with real team environments. But I feel ready for that
          now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each artifact in this portfolio ties together around my goal of
          becoming a full stack developer. They show what I can do in frontend,
          backend, and database layers, and how I've evolved from just writing
          code to actually thinking like a developer. This program gave me the
          foundation I needed, but it's the project work like this that really
          brought everything together.
